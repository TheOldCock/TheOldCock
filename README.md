  I Chose the username TheOldCock because frankly it kind of describes me - I'm old (52) and I've been told I can be kind of a ....and anyway I thought the Admin here would NEVER let me have it.  Plus I have a hand painted English pub sign that shows a rooster described as "The Silver Grey Dorking - The oldest English breed dating since Roman times" it says Whitbread on the top and right underneath says in big letters "THE OLD COCK".  Every chick thinks its funny, but they hate it hanging in plain site  -  makes me like it even more.
- 👀 I’m interested in anything computing really, but my profession is Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) Programming, so any code thats DMIS standard or close or not, I've programmed a variety(Camio,WinCMES,VirtualDMIS,MeasureMax).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Visual Studio to help automate other tasks than running the CMM...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything centered around desktop Windows 10 or 11.  Not interested in mobile applications or AppleOS centered, even though I own a Mac, it just doesn't bring home the bacon.
- 📫 How to reach me - santor.jd@gmail.com is my personal email.  Also anyone around San Antonio, Texas, feel free to drop me a line.  And if you know of a job . . .
That would be fantastic!
